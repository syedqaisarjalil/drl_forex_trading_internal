In our previous work, we developed the data module for a Forex AI Trading system. The module is in the drl_forex_trading_internal package with these key components:

data/fetcher.py: Contains the MT5Fetcher class to connect to MetaTrader 5 and retrieve OHLCV data
data/database.py: Contains the DataManager class that handles storing 1-minute data in PostgreSQL using a schema-based approach with separate tables for each currency pair (e.g., price_data.eurusd_1m)
data/resampler.py: Contains the DataResampler class for on-demand resampling of 1-minute data to higher timeframes
data/updater.py: Contains the DataUpdater class for automating data updates and gap filling

The module is configured via config/main.yml and follows these principles:

Only stores raw 1-minute (M1) data in the database
Performs resampling on-demand when other modules request data at higher timeframes
Designed for scheduled updates via scripts/data_updater.py
Uses PostgreSQL with a schema 'price_data' containing tables like 'eurusd_1m'

We need to continue with implementing the next module [MODULE NAME] which will interact with this data module.
